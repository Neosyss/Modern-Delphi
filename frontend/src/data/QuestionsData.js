            question: "What happens in an oracle consultation?",
            answer: 'An Oracle consultation is a guided experience where you work with a Guide to explore your question, clarify your personal vision, or develop a structured map toward your goals.

        {
            question: "Do I need to prepare anything before my session?",
            answer: "No specific preparation is required, but having a sense of what you'd like to explore can help. If you're unsure, your Guide will help refine your question and shape the session. For goal mapping, reflecting on what you truly want to achieve beforehand can be beneficial. The Oracle has been designed to begin your visioning process and help you recognize your Heroic journey. It serves as a starting point for exploring potential pathways to your goals through reflective prompts and structured dialogue. We encourage you to stay open to new insights that may emerge during the process.",

        {
            question: "How is this different from a tarot reading or psychic session?",
            answer: "Unlike traditional tarot or psychic readings, this experience focuses on structured reflection rather than prediction. The oracle offers symbolic insight, guidance, and deep questioning rather than fixed answers.",
        },
        {
            question: "How is this different from therapy or counseling?",
            answer: "Oracle consultations are not therapy and do not diagnose or treat mental illness. Instead, they focus on personal growth, visioning, and deep reflection. The work is about exploring possibilities, clarifying values, and fostering human flourishing. If you are looking for mental health support, therapy with a professional who is licensed in your area may be more appropriate.",
        },
        {
            question: "Can I ask about anything, or are there topics you won't cover?",

Please note that Oracle consultations are not a substitute for legal, medical, or financial advice. If you require guidance in those areas, we recommend consulting a qualified professional.",
        },
        {
            question: "How do I book a session?",

        {
            question: "Will you tell me my future?",

        },
        {
            question: "How do I know this is real and not just AI-generated fluff?",
            answer: "Kleio's response is meant to spark insight and reflection. If it doesn't resonate, consider the parts that do and engage in further dialogue. The Oracle Guide will also use AI in a personalized manner to help you explore possibilities through insightful questions and interactive reflection. In this new age, AI can be a profound tool for recognizing patterns, refining goals, and supporting your journey toward achieving your dreams. Let's use it wisely.",
        },
        {
            question: "What if I don't like the answer I receive?",
            answer: "If something in your Oracle session does not resonate, that itself can be valuable information. Often, resistance or dissonance can highlight deeper truths worth exploring. Be open with your Guide - whether human or AI - as reflection and dialogue may uncover insights you hadn't considered. Rather than dismissing an idea outright, we encourage you to ask why it doesn't feel right. Does it challenge a belief, reveal an unexpected possibility, or suggest a different perspective? Taking time to reflect on what doesn't resonate can be just as meaningful as what does.",
        },
        {
            question: "Is this confidential?",
            answer: "Yes, all sessions are private and confidential.",

        {
            question: "What if I have technical issues during my session?",

        },
        {
            question: "Is this based on a particular religion or belief system?",
            answer: "Modern Delphi is not tied to any single religion or belief system. It draws on a range of wisdom traditions while respecting individual perspectives.",
        },
        {
            question: "What if I don't believe in oracles? Can I still get something out of this?",
            answer: "Absolutely. This experience is designed to be valuable whether you are spiritual, skeptical, or simply curious. It's about reflection and insight, not belief.",
        },
        {
            question: "How does AI fit into this process?",
            answer: "AI is used as a tool to enhance the experience, offering structured prompts and insights. However, the heart of the session remains a deeply human process.",
